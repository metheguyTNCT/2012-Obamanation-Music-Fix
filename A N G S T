Things like this don’t happen to you, When we… when everything…. Where were they? Your people? Why didn’t they show? How could they? After everything you’ve done for them, leave you here like this? It isn’t fair.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">Landslide<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">Landslide<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Landslide<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The pundits behind their desks, they're ecstatic, vibrating, leering, drooling over the blown-up map, drowning you out. One by one, they sink the hatchet in deeper and deeper, gouging you. They lay it all out, explaining why Americans had so explicitly and horrifically denounced you and your feckless campaign, Trumpism they say is dead, a footnote, a bump in the road of liberal democracy. The Television flickers from MSNBC, where Joy Anne Reid wipes tears from her eyes in awe at the “Complete wholesale rejection of Trump” to CNN where Anderson Cooper recalls that he’s never experienced an election night quite like this one, “It was all downhill from the start” to Fox, those traitors throwing you under the bridge “Perhaps it was a mistake” says Baier “To ever let this man into national politics”. And then the T.V. clicks off, for the first time in a long while, silence echoes through the White House. </p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">HUGE LOSER…</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">HUGE LOSER…</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">HUGE LOSER…</span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>There’s got to be a way back from this, </strong> the illegal voters, yes. Millions and millions of them, stuffing ballot boxes across the country. Voting twice, three times, maybe more. And don’t forget the dead voters, coming out of the woodwork, they’ve done it before, don’t get fooled. And the voting machines, those things are completely rigged, you’ve seen it for yourself, you pull the lever and it switches, its fraud, complete and total fraud.</p>\n    <p>But it still doesn’t add up, how could they? Right across the country, right under everyone’s noses. Well, that was obvious, the news, the fake lying press, they covered it up, covered everything up, slandered you. We should sue, sue them, sue the states, sue everybody, we have to stop this. It’s a complete theft … the biggest fraud in history…</p>\n    <p>But it’s not just the press, it’s the voters, they’ve been duped, taken for a ride. They wouldn’t just do that to you, after everything you’ve done, they’ll come, if we tell them to, they’ll come. The theft is so blatant. As the eerie stillness pervades the White House, you can hear something, fireworks, not on the T.V. from outside the windows, across the whole city. The chanting, the singing, the dancing. Lighting up night skies of hundreds of cities, as millions join the festivities, while your supposed loyal people are nowhere to be seen, they’ve betrayed you, after all you’ve done for them.</p>\n    <p>The phones aren’t ringing, or maybe they are, but no one is answering. Why would they, the parties over, the skeleton staff that stayed through the entire horror show, the ones too dumb to look for another job weeks ago, are now too busy trying to remember this moment, no doubt for some tell-all book they'll write, ‘The End of Donald Trump’ That’s what they’ll call it. An attempt to get through to the RNC is aborted, after it’s leaked that the party is already plotting against you, to purge itself of your element, to deride you as a mere aberration, that the adults are back in charge. The Murdochs, the McConnels, and the McCarthy’s eager to use your final downfall to their benefit.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">It’s Really Over …</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">It’s Really Over …</span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">It’s Really Over …</span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Pence too, that soulless husk has completely flipped, another knife in the back, he wants out of your shadow, as if he could compete, eager to set himself up as the party successor, already hinting that it was he who had curbed your worst impulses, his office isn’t answering, if there’s going to be a speech, he won’t be there, he wants nothing to do with you; because you’re a loser. You lost.</p>\n    <p>That’s it, isn’t it? The whole thing, a big con job, your whole life, one epic tragedy, to take a man who never accomplished a damn thing without Daddy’s help and lift him up. To the highest of heights, a national spectacle, a global celebrity, the biggest brand there is. Only to destroy him and leave him with nothing, because that’s what you are really, deep down, nothing.</p>\n    <p>It's clearer than ever now, you can really see, It’s so obvious, it’s time, to give up. Concede, that will show them, it’s the last thing they expect, they want you to cry and pout on television, to talk about the rigging, and the fraud, and the witch hunts, well. Fuck’em. Let’s concede, thank our wonderful supporters and leave this whole rotten thing behind.</p>\n    <p>You’re out, it’s over. Just imagine, ‘ex-president’, there’s a lot of money to be made in that, and I could go anywhere, do anything, totally unconstrained, the kids, let them fight over what’s left, Melania she can stay in Florida, or leave, it doesn’t matter now.</p>\n    <p>The quickly drafted speech is placed in front of you, it’s good, short and sweet, they’ll love it. Gracious they’ll call you, very gracious.</p>",

It doesn’t make any sense. We were doing so well, nobody had seen anything like it, and everyone was saying it. The crowds—massive, unbelievable.

The experts were right, and you were wrong. Kornaki dances across the screen on MSNBC, flipping counties with his magical wand, red to blue, closing the pathways, shutting the door and trapping you inside. While Maddow's gleaming a smarmy sickly grin, while on Fox the word has come down from on-high as all those gutless empty suits stick the deeper knife inn, all while the presses were rolling out the fattest type fonts they could.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">LOSER<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">LOSER<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">LOSER<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"></span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>We can now project</strong> that Hillary Rodham Clinton, the former first lady, New York Senator, Secretary of State, and the Democratic Nominee of four years ago has been elected the 46th President of the United States. After 4 disastrous years, the woman who many Americans and pundits had long considered politically dead, has proven the country wrong, with her defiant comeback. Corralling her dedicated fanbase within the Democratic party to once again take the party's nomination, with a simple refrain “Re-elect Hillary Clinton”. They said it couldn’t be done, and many of her allies had since turned against her, as the only candidate who had and could again lose to Donald Trump, but tonight she showed the doubters wrong, reframing the 2016 election as an ahistorical error, pointing toward the failed agenda of President Trump, and herself as the opportunity for the nation to course-correct from the disaster she could have prevented.</p>\n    <p> And it looks like the country is in widespread agreement. As Hillary Clinton successfully rebuilt the Democrats winning coalition that narrowly cost her the Presidency last time. This was a truly historic night, the first Presidential rematch since 1956, Hillary will be the first woman-President and though this election has not exactly been policy-focused, we’re certain that President Clinton has much in store for the country she has been running to be President of for the last 12 years. </p>\n    <p>This can’t be happening, and your people, across the country. They can see it too, the greatest fraud in history, we were so close, how could we lose? Look at them, the energy, the unrelenting passion as they pound on the doors, and demand their votes be counted accurately, we have the real Americans. Who do they have? As if on cue, there they are, dancing, singing, reveling in their supposed victory. They think they’ve won, that it’s all over, that they can turn the page on you, shut you out, clog their ears. On CNN Anderson Cooper takes his viewers to a firework display in San Francisco as the crowd is illuminated under the red, white and blue spectacle, they’re in ecstasy, unshackled, free for the first time in years. </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>“HILLARY!!!!!!!!”</strong> The superfans blazed, without a dry eye in the auditorium, as the fireworks lit the skies in bright white bursts. Illuminating the faces in the crowd. Their spirits lifted all at once, from a 4 year-long depression, passions fully aflame. “It’s been too long, this was her moment, her time”. These are the die-hards, who never gave up on their candidate, “We’ve had a Russian stooge in the White House, that orange maniac, and now it’s time for a real President. Hillary … she’s the boss now.”. Yes, a lot of people assumed that the pantsuit nation died 4 years ago, but no, it lay dormant, waiting for its standard bearer to return, and return she did, with a vengeance. Many in the punditry have tried to dissect what the difference is between the Hillary of 2016 and the Hillary of 2020, but the difference is clear from the ground, this is a battle-hardened Hillary, she and her supporters have loved and lost, and were determined not to a second time, without a single grudge or slight against them forgotten, all those who doubted she could be the one to defeat Donald Trump, probably have their names on list.</p>\n    <p>The hollowed-out ghosts stalk you, clawing at you. Trying to understand what you are saying, directing your campaign staff to make phone calls, the Murdochs, McConnell, McCarthy. They‘re dismissive, their sniveling conniving voices betray their pitiful apologies “I’m sorry Mr. President”. Traitors, how could they do this, after all you’ve done for them? Don’t they see, we killed them, it’s over.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Pence enters, his whimpering putrid smile plastered to his face, appears to be trying to console you, but you slap the words out of his mouth.

Mike’s face shifts, just a glint but you catch it, he’s spooked.</p>\n    <p>These cowardly, weak idiots. Are they blind, it’s obvious they’re stealing it. With the markers, and the blinders. They’re using the election against me. It’s rigged. They want me to concede well fuck them, we'll never concede.</p>\n    <p>Of these people only a few really get it Rudy, he sees it, it’s obvious, we have to declare victory. If we don’t, it’s over. We have to get out there and tell them, tell them to stop the count, stop the fraud, stop the steal.</p>\n    <p>The family try to hide themselves, those feckless disasters. Only Melania stays, watching the television, enraptured, muttering to herself in Slovenian.</p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>Then the news comes through,</strong></p>\n    <p>Live shots from the DNC, Clinton and Hickenlooper are going to speak, even though we haven’t conceded.

Well then, here we are …\"</p>\n    <p>“This is a victory for the decent Americans, for the reasonable Americans and everyone who dreams better for this country… ”</p>\n    <p>“This is a message to the world, America may make mistakes, sometimes big ones, but unlike other nations, we’re not afraid to reassess…”</p>\n    <p>Everyone out there, little girls and little boys, they can look up today and see that in this country, we stand up to bullies, and no matter what you’ve gone through, who you are, or what they say about you. YOU WILL SURVIVE …”</p>\n    <p>“If you dream big, work hard, and always persist, there are no limits, you can make this country greater, bring people together and yes, you can be President….”</p>\n    <p>\"Thank you and may God forever bless the United States of America!\"</p>\n    <p>We’ll be back, you say to yourself, America loves a comeback story...</p>",

This place, it's a joke, the marble columns, chandeliers, and paintings, it's all just cheap theatre, set dressing while all the real power lurks in the wings, commanding the lights, conducting the music, writing the lines. All these men, in the pictures and paintings, they all knew it too, and each played the part without question, actors playing the part.

Finally, when the room has been appropriately redecorated, and a modicum of composure rebuilt, do you realize, that the doors have completely vanished.</p>\n    <p>Where they once were the walls are smooth and bare, without any evidence of a door having ever been there, groping for a door handle results in nothing. Crossing over the other side of the room, there is similarly nothing, not even an outline, so you pound and wail and beg, but no one comes. No-one cares. How much time passes is uncertain, the clocks having been smashed so completely looking out the windows there is only a dark thick fog, that only reflects the oval prison you are trapped in.</p>",

Trump has been re-elected President of the United States. After 4 years of messy leadership. The President was able to win his second term, convincing enough Americans to stick with his brand of conservatism, over that of his opponent Pete Buttigieg. The former Mayor of South Bend, he entered the race with very little political experience, and almost no national profile, Pete was at best a politically confused candidate who struggled to define himself on the issues, only emerging as the Democratic nominee, after a bevy of other moderate Democrats failed to find their footing in the race, with his unique appeal as both a veteran, the youngest candidate in the race, and being a gay man.</p>\n    <p>However, his inexperience only opened up his campaign to accusations of flip-flopping on key issues, accusations over his credentials and past employment came under intense media scrutiny, and his homosexuality possibly proved a detriment to socially conservative voters. Pete’s loss puts him in a strange place in politics, though young he holds no elected office and there are no obvious avenues for a state-wide position opening up, though perhaps he will find a position, in a future Democratic administration.</p>\n    <p>Your people, there they are, across the country, celebrating, chanting, reveling. Your victory is theirs; Your America is theirs, changed forever and this victory has calcified it, in the decades and centuries to come they will remember what you’ve done for your people, and all the haters will be long forgotten. And then finally the real show starts, the opposite picture, the petrified faces, glistening with tears, heads in hands, complete and utter despair, lost little lambs alone in the wilderness, the weakness that infests this country. On CNN Anderson Cooper describes the scene as he sees it, at an outdoor drive-in rally, they look like refugees, totally adrift from their homeland.</p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>The cold wind was blowing,</strong>eyes welled with tears, and partners embraced one another in solum displays of solidarity. “I always knew it could go this way, that America wouldn’t accept him, but it’s painful because it may never happen again, in my lifetime”. Polls consistently showed that even most Democrats were uncertain if their country was ready to elect a gay President, and many in the crowd were annoyed by what they saw as an openly homophobic administration deliberately using that sentiment to drive its campaign. “What we saw here was an expression of hate, cis-men, expressing their inherent in many cases subliminal anti-gay rage” Though a renegade few were willing to go after the Pete campaign “Where were the issues? You can’t beat Donald Trump in a contest of ego, where did we get that idea?” </p>\n    <p>The phones had been ringing off the hook. All those backstabbing two-timers, Murdoch, McConnell, McCarthy. They’d written you off, counted you out, and left you for dead. But now they’ve come crawling back. “Congratulations Mr. President” their sheepish, feeble voices emote over the phone. You thank them and make sure that they understand the unparalleled nature of your victory, but you don’t listen to what they have to say, why would you? You don’t need them. You don’t need anyone.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">We Won<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Pence and Karen enter dressed for the cameras, someone apparently told them to be ready for a victory speech.

Don and Eric alongside Lara and Kimberly are fast at work, parading your victory, snickering in the enemies' faces, Ivanka and Jared accept calls on your behalf, foreign dignitaries desperately trying to reach you, to be first to pour on the flattery, and to beg the United States to remember the sanctity of its alliances.</p>\n    <p>But you won’t take them, there’s only one call that counts now, and you need to hear it.</p>\n    <p>Melania prepares to leave, she says there is no use in staying up, it’s all over, you ask if she’ll come down for the speech but she doesn’t answer, and you realize you don’t really care.

Perhaps they were strategizing, hopelessly combing for another path, a way back, but it wasn’t there.</p>\n    <p>“Hello Mr. President, it’s Pete.” </p>\n    <p>That’s right Pete, just Pete. Not a Mayor, certainly not a President. </p>\n    <p>“Well, our guys, have determined that there is no sufficient path forward for our campaign, and so we’re conceding, as it were.” </p>\n    <p>That’s right, breathe it in Pete. This is the last night that you’ll mean anything to anyone. How embarrassing for him, to have peaked so young, with nothing but disappointment left ahead.</p>\n    <p>“It’s been a good campaign, we’ve raised a lot of issues, and going forward I hope it contributes to our nation's continued success.”</p>\n    <p>He desperately tries to squeeze some inkling of a victory out of his utter defeat. The phone is handed over to someone else and shortly after Pete Bu—whatever his name is, vanishes from your memory.</p>",

And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. <br><br>And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose.<br><br>And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It's a disgrace.

We're not going to let it happen, I'm not going to let it happen.<br><br>That election, our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening.

For the last two years, these well-monied men and women had told themselves that change was on the horizon. They had told themselves that the last twelve years of liberal hegemony would finally be at an end. It had to be. How much longer would they have to endure this expansion of the national debt? How much longer would they have to watch as the Democrats surrendered their country’s imperial possessions? How much longer would these liberals force integration down their throats?<br><br>The night had started off with such high hopes, with the party mocking the media for overstating Kennedy’s odds. As the night went on, all but a few true believers had accepted the inevitable. Though there were still votes to count and states to call, Kennedy was on track to victory. They called it for Kennedy at 11:39 PM. Rockefeller came out three minutes later. No music. No warm-up. Just the sound of a thousand jaws tensing at once. He walked like a man who couldn’t believe he was upright. But his eyes were wide open. And absolutely pissed.<br><br>He marched up to the microphone.<br><br>“You blew it.”<br><br>The room froze.<br><br>“You blew it.”<br><br>He scanned the crowd. Not with sadness. With contempt.<br><br>“You told me to wait in 1960. I waited. You told me to step aside in 1964 for a landslide defeat. I stepped aside. You ran a clown in ‘68 and told me I was too much. Now, finally, when it was too damn late to fix the damage, you came crawling back for me to save you.”<br><br>His voice rose.<br><br>“Well, I came. I came. I gave it everything. And you, you, couldn’t even show up with a full deck.”<br><br>He pointed directly at the press row. <br><br>“You handed me a party fractured in three directions. You saddled me with a platform stitched with a fishing line. You thought I could clean it up for you. That’d I’d take the hit and smile for the cameras. That I’d lose politely. Well, to hell with that. Screw all of you.”<br><br>A gasp from somewhere in the hall. <br><br>“I don’t lose politely. I don’t lose for you. You don’t get to use me as a fig leaf for your cowardice. You don’t get to prop me up for a ‘unity’ pledge then undercut me with whispers and whining and leaks and knives in the ribs every goddamn day of this campaign.”<br><br>He grabbed the edge of the podium. White-knuckled.<br><br>“You owe me a victory.”<br><br>“I built this party’s last chance. I handed you a path. You spit on it. Don’t talk to me about loyalty. Don’t talk to me about ‘next time’. You had your shot. And now—”<br>The numbers were bleeding out across the ticker, and it was just after midnight when Spiro Agnew stormed out onto the stage. He shoved past a handler, yanked the curtain across, and pulled the microphone towards him.<br><br>“They stole it.”<br><br>No warning. Just the shot. And now the chaser.<br><br>“You saw it. We all saw it. Dead men voting in Chicago. Boxes dumped in the harbor. Mobs in Philadelphia. A thousand people are dragging this country into the sewer.”<br><br>He wasn’t looking at the crowd. He was looking somewhere else. Somewhere worse.<br><br>“This was a heist. It was a crime scene. Everyone in the media is on it. They helped it happen. They want it this way. They want you ashamed, broke, obedient, and now they want you quiet.”<br><br>He jabbed a finger toward the back of the room. Toward no one.<br><br>“I ran on law and order, they answered with looting and lies. I ran on pride, they smeared it in filth. And now I gotta come out here and concede? Smile for the cameras?”<br><br>He laughed. One hard, empty bark.<br><br>“No. No, I’m not going to tell them that. I’m going to say the truth. They stole it. They’re gonna try and investigate me, for all sorts of things. They had this lined up from the start.”<br><br>“I won all those states. I won America. But you don’t win when the game’s rigged. You don’t win when the ref’s in on it. You don’t win when they’ve got a file with your name on it marke—”<br>There was a sharp tug on his sleeve. Rogers Morton looked down to see one of aides, pimply-faced, wearing a dress shirt too large for him. He stared at the boy. The boy cleared his throat expectantly. Morton, realizing what was happening, gave an apologetic “Oh!” and folded his enormous body to try and reach the aide’s level. Still, the child had to stand on his tip-toes to reach Morton’s ear.<br><br>“Sir, I’m so sorry to bother…”<br><br>Morton waved him off. With the way things were going, he was glad for the distraction.<br><br>“It’s just that, someone’s been calling you all night. I’ve been trying to handle it myself, but the phone’s been ringing off the hook.”<br><br>His feeling of nausea intensified. The damn phone. He could not imagine who was calling him tonight of all nights, but it could not be good.<br><br>“Who is it?”<br><br>The boy shrugged. <br><br>“I couldn’t make it out. Something about the future of the party?”<br><br>Morton let out a petulant groan. With how things were tonight, he could not afford to alienate another person.<br><br>“Alright. Alright. I’ll handle it. Just tell me where the phone is.”<br><br>Together, the pair tried to disentangle themselves from the throngs. They pushed past old women who had long-since stopped waving their miniature American flags. They passed exhausted oil executives and priests. A middle-aged car dealer looked furious, refusing to believe that ${candidatefullname} was on the verge of conceding when there were so many states left to call.<br><br>As they approached the back of the room, the aide pointed to a door. Morton gave a nod of appreciation, opened the door, and hurried inside. <br><br>His first thought upon entering was that the room was too large. Instead of the cramped, wood-paneled and cigarette-smelling room he’d imagined, Morton found himself at the back of what seemed like an enormous auditorium. Rows of seats stretched out before him, each packed with people. Their focus was concentrated on the stage in front of them, at the telephone illuminated by a single spotlight. Rogers stared at it. As it began to ring, he saw himself—or a facsimile of himself—emerge from off-stage and answer it.<br><br>“Sorry,” said the false Morton is a waspish nasal. “This is… You’ve reached the residence of… Oh sorry! Sorry. I’m so sorry!”<br><br>The audience let out a laugh. Morton said nothing. He felt hot and sickly in the darkness. Sweat formed on the back of his neck.<br><br>“Oh, it’s not my fault if people are mad at me! It’s just not a fair world. If it were, I’d be some bit player in Washington and doing something important… like sailing boats on the Chesapeake!”<br><br>More laughter at the impotent tantrum. The other Morton talked and talked. It wasn’t his fault, he pleaded. Other performers appeared on stage and dismissed him as he splayed his enormous body out in supplication. Couldn’t they understand how much he’d sacrificed, he pathetically muttered. He’d given up his dignity, his principles. He’d been willing to destroy his country’s future success. He’d done it all to accommodate them, to get the party over the finish line. Oh why couldn’t anyone—.<br><br>The false Morton tripped over his own telephone wire. Laughter exploded through the room again. Morton felt like he might vomit.<br><br>Was this how people saw him? Was this how they saw Republicans? Had all his humiliations, all his sacrifices been in service of a world that would never like or respect him?<br><br>Yes, thought Morton dismally. It was never about being liked. That had been the trap, the illusion. He’d spent years imagining that dignity and sacrifice might one day be rewarded, but that wasn’t what history remembered. It remembered victory and he had failed to deliver. <br><br>He was a joke without a punchline. He was will without power. This entire period, the last four years of his life, would be swallowed up and remembered only as a vehicle for Kennedy’s story. He was Bobby’s comic relief. If Republicans eventually clawed their way back to relevance, it would have to be under the terms Kennedy and his ilk dictated. <br><br>And he wouldn’t be a part of that.<br><br>As laughter crackled through the theatre, Morton turned toward the door and stepped through the threshold once more. He was once again back in New York. The candidate was finishing his concession speech. The crowd in the hotel was beginning to retreat back to their rooms.<br><br>“Is everything all right, sir?” <br><br>Morton looked down and saw the anxious aide who had first grabbed him. He gave the boy a forced smile.<br><br>“As alright as it will ever be.”</p>",

Still, he tried to maintain his dignity. He had conceded early on Election Night, his surrender graciously accepted by his opponent. He had returned to a White House already beginning to thin as staff looked for other jobs and opportunities. He had pushed forward by doing what he had always done—burying himself in his work. He accepted briefings on the situation in Vietnam, on the struggling economy, on the unrest in cities. <br><br>He gave speeches and issued orders, trying his hardest to ignore the obvious absurdity of it all. Anything he did now would likely be reversed by his successor. He wasn’t president at all. He was a child playing dress up. He wasn’t growing up. He was growing down. As he looked at the newspapers bemoaning every aspect of his Administration, it felt like the entire nation was doing the same.<br><br>Still, he pressed onward. He pressed himself through empty White House hallways, past Secret Service agents who looked at him with a mix of curiosity and sadness. He sealed himself inside his Office, once again ignoring pleas from his wife and his children to enjoy what time he had remaining. He had no intention of doing that. <br><br>There was work to be done. Phone calls to be answered. The answering machine on his desk blinked. Without hesitation, he clicked the button labeled “PLAY”. As the tape whirred, he pretended to organize his paperwork.<br><br>“Bob, it’s Larry O’Brien. I was surprised to receive your call the other day, but I wanted to return it and, uh, wish you a happy birthday.” There was a pause. Something going unsaid. “I’d be happy to help with whatever project you got cooked up after January, but, uh, let’s table that, alright? It’s only been a few weeks.”<br><br>The president scowled. He moved several useless papers from his inbox to his outbox.<br><br>“Bobby, this is Jeff Greenfield. First off, congrats on turning 47. Second, I, uh, got your message about wanting to do a Farewell Address. I’m not sure if you’ve seen the polling numbers recently, but we should maybe discuss options before we go that direction. I’ll send you a memo.”<br><br>Bobby gathered up a collection of documents and slammed them into his garbage bin. He did nothing when the bin tipped sideways.<br><br>“Mr. President, this is Earl Graves. I appreciate you reaching out on your birthday and all, but I don’t think, this close after the election, is the right time to reach out to black—.”<br><br>The president jerked the answering machine toward him and hit the “STOP” button with his thumb. The room lapsed itself into silence. He was alone again. He was alone again in the same room where Jack had spent the last few hours of his life. Unlike Jack, there was no possibility of making his presidency mean anything, of the fight for civil rights or economic justice continue. Instead of being martyred for something greater than himself, his defeat had made his ideas smaller and more marginal. <br><br>Had Jack feared this? As his car glided down those Dallas streets, had he worried that his vitality would be sapped from him? That he might disappoint the country in ‘64 and everything he fought for and believed in would be forgotten?<br><br>He could still remember getting the call from his brother Ted, two days after his birthday. He had been staring at the mass of cheery birthday cards in his garbage bin as his brother wept through the phone, “I’m so sorry. Robert, I’m so sorry. In Dallas. They say in Dallas he was—. Oh Robert. Bobby. Oh, Bobby. I’m sorry he’s—.”<br><br>“Surprise!” <br><br>Lights blared to life overhead. He dropped the papers he’d been holding and only now saw it for what they were—a cheap stage prop. He looked around his office to see it too transformed. He could see through the artifice, through the cheapness of the scenery. A paper American flag. A chipped desk. A plastic red telephone. Jack’s portrait. Less objects than a recreation of them. A memory. A haunting.<br><br>Then, situated across from him, a mass of bodies. Ethel. Moynihan. Unruh. Shriver. Byrd. Connally. Long. McNamara. He stared uncomprehendingly at their smiling faces, at the cake in his wife’s outstretched arms, and then at what lay beyond them, stirring in the darkness beyond him.<br><br>“Oh happy birthday, Bobby!” said the crowd as one. <br><br>Bobby remained frozen beneath the spotlight. His mouth opened and shut as his brain processed what was happening. “N-No… No, this isn’t…”<br><br>“Isn’t what, Bobby-buddy?” said Connally with an exaggerated wink. “Forty-seven is nothing to scoff at. Hell, that’s more birthdays than Jack got.”<br><br>“No. No, I mean, this isn’t what I came here to do. I have work. I have so much work to—.” He was rambling, he knew. His mouth felt dry. <br><br>“Christ, kiddo, leave the work for someone more capable,” said Byrd, detaching himself from the crowd to pick up the papers strewn across the stage. “Haven’t you made enough of a mess already? I mean, God, the stories people will tell about this…”<br><br>“Bobby the fumbler. Bobby the dunce,” said Long, observing Byrd. He frowned. “It doesn’t really have the same ring to it.”<br><br>Shriver cut in, “But I’m sure you’ll be around for a long enough time to make it mean something. You could live another 60, 70 years if you’re lucky. By that time, all these fights about Vietnam, the economy… they’ll seem like nothing.”<br><br>“Will be nothing,” Byrd corrected, now back on his feet.<br><br>“You’ll have your library, your parties to focus on the good stuff like your speeches. All your petty little family dramas. Oh, boy, they’ll get a kick out of the Jack thing. Very cinematic, very <i>theatrical</i>,”  said Connally. “They’ll find meaning in that, long after they’ve forgotten everything you stood for.”<br><br>There was a guffaw of laughter from somewhere out in the darkness. Bobby spun to face it. If he focused hard, he could just make out the masses beyond those stage lights. Countless generations, all watching him. If he could just reach them, hold their hands…<br><br>“No, it was never about any of that,” muttered Kennedy, still staring into the dark. “I never wanted to be just another face on the wall. We were supposed to finish the work. We were supposed to do something, to embody change…”<br><br>“Strange way of embodying it,” said Long. “All those compromises.”<br><br>“All those dead,” said McNamara in a dark and sullen voice.<br><br>There was a long sigh as Moynihan adjusted his spectacles. “Oh, not to worry, Bobby. This country’s yet to find a president it couldn’t add to the pantheon. You’ll maybe not be as bright a star, but you’ll be fine. You lot always are.”<br><br>The president took a step away from the stage’s edge. “This can’t be how it ends. It just can’t,” he muttered. “What about all those possibilities we used to dream of? What about those…”<br><br>“Things that never were?”<br><br>It was his wife’s voice that broke the silence this time. He turned to look at her. She had a strange, sad expression. The cake’s flickering candles made her look ghostly.<br><br>“Come on, Bobby, you had your chance,” she said quietly. “All that’s left now is to pick up the pieces and get off the stage. It’s time to blow out your candles.”<br><br>“Try not to blow it this time,” said Long.<br><br>“Close your eyes.”<br><br>“Hope for something better.”<br><br>“Try to make it a good one.”<br><br>There was nowhere else to go. Nothing else to do. He gave one last look across the stage and then to the crowd judging him from beyond. Then, he shut his eyes, took a deep breath, and blew.</p></div>",

Couldn’t see it, all the fraud that was in plain sight, all those ballots dumped across the country, the screens and dividers propped up to conceal the truth. But you could see it, the true patriots could see it. And they wouldn’t allow it, couldn’t allow our beautiful country to be destroyed like this. Spineless Republicans just wanted to roll over and watch as the greatest landslide in history was stolen from them. Because they are weak, cowardly traitors. And when the time came, what happened to them? They ran with the rest, retreated into their little hideaways, and blocked the doors. I hear poor little Schiff was crouching in a closet when they got to him.</p>\n    <p>It couldn’t be denied, we had the crowds. The biggest crowds, they’d ever seen. So many, and they came ready to fight, fight for their country, and fight for our great victory. We wanted to do it peacefully, it would have been easy all they had to do was listen, and look at all the corruption across the country, there’s so much evidence, and the courts would have been with us. But they wouldn’t throw out the phony ballots, we had to show them, how mad our people are about this. They don’t want the election stolen, some people get hurt, and some people get shot, but those were Antifa people, not our people. If they all just came out, Nancy and the rest, and admitted to everyone the horrible fraud that happened, it wouldn’t have come to this.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">TRUMP!<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">TRUMP!<span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">TRUMP! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p><span style=\"padding-left: 5em;\"><strong>“We can now report that</strong>, Secretary Christopher Miller has urged the National Guard forces not to enter the Capitol grounds, presumably on the orders of the President despite the presence of a riotous mob that has taken over the Capitol building, we have reports that legislators have been taken hostage, video of the mob burning papers and what some are claiming are the electoral ballots, it’s chaos up there and the most shocking moment perhaps when the President of the United States, flew overhead in Marine One, after releasing a statement that can only be described as cheering on this mob, there are smaller incidents in buildings across D.C. including the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee where the President-elect was mere hours ago, it’s pure chaos out here, there has been no report on the whereabouts of either the Vice-President, or Speaker Pelosi, however waves of condemnation of the violence in the city and the lack of police or National Guard response has, at least from the nations Democrats been unanimous … Hold on we have another Tweet from the President I’ll read it verbatim. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What Happened at the Capitol Today Shows What Happens When A Great Victory is STOLEN, Great Patriots Stand Up And FIGHT, THANK YOU ALL, BIG NEWS SOON!!!'</em></strong> … I have no idea what that could mean.”</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">FIGHT! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">FIGHT! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">FIGHT! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>Passing through the halls, you can still see them, the handwringers, twitchy wimps scuttering into offices, trying their best to get their testimony straight if things go south.

A few phone calls reach the right places, the Loyalists, one by one, urging the Vice-President to make the right decision this time all they need is a pep talk from you. “We’re doing so great, you’ve seen the fraud, those people with you can certainly see it, everyone else can, why can’t you?” And soon enough they fall in line, cheered on by the patriot army, confirming your victory. </p>\n    <p>It's a glorious day, the rotten media don’t see it. They were perfectly happy when their side rigs elections, but oh you’ve gone too far, how dare you stand up for yourself, how dare you fight back. Complete enemies of the people, calling it an ‘insurrection’ What does that even mean? This is love, great love for our country, tremendous respect for our country, that’s why we’re doing this. Where’s Nancy? She ran into the tunnels but, no one’s really seen her, I wanted to call her, check if she was OK, perhaps we could work things out after all, we could wrap things up, quite quickly and everyone would go home, that would be the patriotic thing to do, but she didn’t so we had to do it the hard way.</p>\n    <p>\n    <strong>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">NANCY! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 16px;\">NANCY! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    <span style=\"font-size: 20px;\">NANCY! <span style=\"padding-left: 2em;\"> </span>\n    </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>The White House, this stony temple, an ode to the great Roman Republic.

That’s what we’re doing stopping, the barbarians. The phone calls keep coming, as you sit and watch on the many screens, every network, every channel in the world.

A real humdinger, the speech of the century.

            "description": "<h3>On the Front Lines</h3>\n              <p>George felt strange standing inside the elementary school classroom. It was not just the size of the chairs and desks, which left him feeling enormous and plodding, nor the colorful decorations pasted against white cement walls. It was a… synchronicity, he thought, surprising himself with the word. A sense of deja vu. Staring at a dry erase board covered in a teacher’s careful scrawl, he felt like he had lived this moment before.<br><br>The feeling scared him. He cleared his throat and ignored the uniformed military aide waiting for his order.<br><br>“So, uh, should we get back out there and show these folks a good time.”<br><br>Chief of Staff Andy Card stood against the wall. He seemed dazed. He stared wordlessly at the open black briefcase and the documents scattered across the teacher’s desk. Keys in the ignition. A cheer echoed through the walls, as the earliest states reported their returns. <br><br>“Come on, now. Look, it’s important… It’s important that we take this as it comes. Don’t want to spook people,” George nodded, his speech growing faster as he talked. Endless sunny optimism. “Keep it going. Keep the machine going, y'know what I mean? These people came for a good time…”<br><br>“Mr. President,” said Andy.<br><br>“Deal with the problem in the morning but now we have a show…”<br><br>“George,” Card’s voice was a croak.<br><br>George let out a shrill laugh. He was beginning to grow angry now. He didn’t understand why Andy was acting like this, why he was trying to fuck him raw, after all they’d done to prove themselves to Dick, to Ted, to Poppy. There was another cheer from the auditorium. They were so close to the precipice. <br><br>He gave Andy a smile so sharp it could cut. “We can’t disappoint these people. We’ve done so much. We’ve handled the situation. Deciding. I’m the decider. They’re voting now because—.”<br><br>“Mr. President,” the uniformed man’s voice was firm but surprisingly gentle. George turned. <br><br>“You have just ordered a nuclear strike on a hostile government.” A beat. “As we speak, your order is being transmitted. It will be acted upon imminently if not already.” Another beat. “Once the Government of China’s early warning systems detect our launch, they will retaliate.” The man’s eyes were not unkind, but they bored into his own. “Do you understand?”<br><br>George stared uncomprehending, his mouth agape. He wondered if Poppy was watching the returns right now, if he was sitting in his carpeted study with its red telephones and briefing papers and miniature cathode television and knick-knacks accumulated over a lifetime of service and distinction and good judgment. He wondered if he was waiting for him to call, waiting for his son, as he sipped on brandy and watched the returns pour in.<br><br>The military aide turned to Card. “I need you to get the president’s detail. We have maybe twenty minutes to get to the airport and for Air Force One to be wheels up—with as many people aboard as possible.”<br><br>The order went through Andy like a jolt. He left the room and was screaming for agents, who were even now barreling down the hallway. George felt himself being grabbed gruffly around the jacket, feeling the stitching come loose as he half-walked, half-skidded down linoleum tiles away from an auditorium of supporters. He could see the surprised faces of reporters and volunteers watching the president be dragged through a school. He could hear the low thrum of a helicopter being started.<br><br>This was all wrong. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be happening. He needed his bagman. He needed Blake to give him his cell phone. He was supposed to be in DC with Laura and the girls and an adoring crowd at the Reagan Center that screamed like falling rockets. He needed the gleaming lights and sounds. Instead, he found himself hurried into the night, lifted into the chopper, and strapped into a chair.<br><br>“But I still have to talk to Poppy,” George mumbled. <br><br>His military aide did not respond as he slammed the helicopter door shut. He could not see the man’s face as the vehicle went airborn.</p><h3>HOUSE INTRANET »  COMMISSION ON THE 2004 NUCLEAR EXCHANGE » STAFF_REPORT_2004 COMMISSION_v12_DRAFT.doc</h3>\n              <p><b>[THIS FILE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED. PLEASE OPEN AND REPAIR TO AN EARLIER VERSION.]</b><br><br>...As the Chinese missiles climbed into space, they came into full view of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense system, originally the National Missile Defense system, in Alaska. Inaugurated in June 2002 at Fort Greely, it saw various improvements through July 2004. The system represented the largest and most sophisticated anti-missile defense system on earth despite the many compromises made in its design.<br><br>While DoD staff were publicly laudatory about the system and the Alaska National Guard Troops who managed it, they privately criticized the various malfunctions it demonstrated during testing. The failure rate during drills was high. Even if it had not been, officials worried about whether the system could operate effectively in an exchange scenario. “There was no way to prove its effectiveness before the crisis,” said one DoD official. “We t▯lked about it being the ‘last line of defense,’ but it was always more a shiny deterrence system than anything ready for prime time.’”<br><br>Indeed, despite the technological sophistication of this system—possible due to an estimated ▯▯▯▯llion-dollar in▯estment—it faced certain unavoidable scientific truths. In any exchange scenario, guardsmen would have an extremely narrow range during which to intercept targets. A long-range m▯ssile is almost impossible to hit while all its engines are firing. As a warhead falls to earth, it reaches twenty times the speed of sound, making it almost impossible to intercept. Only between these moments—the “midcourse” when a hot warhead is drifting through space—is it possible to shoot down. This period is, at most, a f▯w minutes in length if a missile is detec▯▯d at launch. It can be mere seconds if radar systems fail to detect an incoming warhead in time̶.̴ ̵<br><br>S̴o̴ ̵i̸t̵ was on November 2, 2004. With no warning or preparation, a skeleton crew of Alaska National Guard troops became charged with using the nation’s forty-four operational interceptors to defend the United States against an estimated 500 incoming warheads. Operators would have little knowledge of which missiles were aimed at which target nor would they have been able to think critically during the short time frame. Given that the GMD had a success rate of only about 50 percent—even under ideal testing conditions—those manning the interceptors would have had to accommodate accordingly. <br><br>Acting Secretary of Defense Stephen C▯▯▯ｏne—who declined to cooperate but had commented on nuclear defense and readiness prior to the incident—has offered his own, blunt view about what this accommodation lik▯▯▯ would have been:<br><br>“F̷i̸r̸e̸ ̵a̶ ̶l̸o̵t̷ ̴o̵f̷ interceptors at every missile and hope you get lucky.”<br><br>Staff have been unable to find a surviving member of the Ala▯▯▯ National Guard to confirm this fact. It is disputed by surviving Executive staff whether the GMD system successfully intercepted any Chi▯▯▯▯ missiles on November 2, 2004.<br><br>CHAPTER IV: “WHEELS UP”<br><br>According to witness testimony and fli▯ht records, President Bush’s helicopter landed on the tarmac of Des Moines International Airport at 11:08 PM, three minutes after departing Theodore Roosevelt High School, eight minutes after polls closed in California, and 12 minutes before the impact of the Chinese ICBM targeted on the president’s location.

As the pr▯▯▯dent settled into his seat, Ms Alexandra Pelosi of NBC recalls the president asking his security detail about his phone and repeating the phrase, “Do you think P▯ppy’ll be okay?”<br><br>There is no indication the Pr▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯tempted to get in contact with Vice President Ch▯ney or any other member of the Cabinet—many of whｏm subsequently ▯▯▯▯▯▯ed. <br><br>Air Force One was wheels up at 11:17 PM. The surviving crew recalled the viole▯▯▯ of the take-off. Passengers, many of whom had not yet been able to secure themselves in their seats, were similarly shaken. “It was like a rocket,” said Elisabeth Bumiller of the New York Tim▯▯.
